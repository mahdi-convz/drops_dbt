# Apple Search Ads Source dbt Package ([Docs](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_apple_search_ads_source/))
# 📣 What does this dbt package do?
- Materializes [Apple Search Ads staging tables](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_apple_search_ads_source/#!/overview/apple_search_ads_source/models/?g_v=1&g_e=seeds) which leverage data in the format described by [this ERD](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/apple-search-ads#schemainformation). These staging tables clean, test, and prepare your Apple Search Ads data from [Fivetran's connector](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/apple-search-ads) for analysis by doing the following:
  - Names columns for consistency across all packages and for easier analysis
  - Adds freshness tests to source data
  - Adds column-level testing where applicable. For example, all primary keys are tested for uniqueness and non-null values.
- Generates a comprehensive data dictionary of your apple_search_ads data through the [dbt docs site](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_apple_search_ads_source/).
- These tables are designed to work simultaneously with our [Apple Search Ads transformation package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_apple_search_ads).

# 🎯 How do I use the dbt package?
## Step 1: Prerequisites
To use this dbt package, you must have the following:
- At least one Fivetran Apple Search Ads connector syncing data into your destination. 
- A **BigQuery**, **Snowflake**, **Redshift**, **PostgreSQL**, or **Databricks** destination.

### Databricks Dispatch Configuration
If you are using a Databricks destination with this package you will need to add the below (or a variation of the below) dispatch configuration within your `dbt_project.yml`. This is required in order for the package to accurately search for macros within the `dbt-labs/spark_utils` then the `dbt-labs/dbt_utils` packages respectively.
```yml
dispatch:
  - macro_namespace: dbt_utils
    search_order: ['spark_utils', 'dbt_utils']
```

## Step 2: Install the package (skip if also using the `apple_search_ads` transformation package)
If you  are **not** using the [Apple Search Ads transformation package](https://github.com/fivetran/apple_search_ads), include the following apple_search_ads_source package version in your `packages.yml` file.
> TIP: Check [dbt Hub](https://hub.getdbt.com/) for the latest installation instructions or [read the dbt docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/package-management) for more information on installing packages.
```yaml
packages:
  - package: fivetran/apple_search_ads_source
    version: [">=0.2.0", "<0.3.0"] # we recommend using ranges to capture non-breaking changes automatically
```
## Step 3: Define database and schema variables
By default, this package runs using your destination and the `apple_search_ads` schema. If this is not where your Apple Search Ads data is (for example, if your Apple Search Ads schema is named `apple_search_ads_fivetran`), add the following configuration to your root `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
vars:
    apple_search_ads_database: your_destination_name
    apple_search_ads_schema: your_schema_name 
```

## (Optional) Step 4: Additional configurations
<details><summary>Expand for configurations</summary>

### Passing Through Additional Metrics
By default, this package will select `clicks`, `impressions`, and `cost` from the source reporting tables to store into the staging models. If you would like to pass through additional metrics to the staging models, add the below configurations to your `dbt_project.yml` file. These variables allow for the pass-through fields to be aliased (`alias`) if desired, but not required. Use the below format for declaring the respective pass-through variables:

>**Note** Please ensure you exercised due diligence when adding metrics to these models. The metrics added by default (taps, impressions, and spend) have been vetted by the Fivetran team maintaining this package for accuracy. There are metrics included within the source reports, for example metric averages, which may be inaccurately represented at the grain for reports created in this package. You will want to ensure whichever metrics you pass through are indeed appropriate to aggregate at the respective reporting levels provided in this package.

```yml
vars:
    apple_search_ads__ad_group_passthrough_metrics: 
      - name: "new_custom_field"
        alias: "custom_field"
      - name: "another_one"
    apple_search_ads__ad_passthrough_metrics:
      - name: "this_field"
    apple_search_ads__campaign_passthrough_metrics:
      - name: "unique_string_field"
        alias: "field_id"
    apple_search_ads__keyword_passthrough_metrics:
      - name: "that_field"
    apple_search_ads__search_term_passthrough_metrics:
      - name: "other_id"
        alias: "another_id"
```
### Disabling Additional Models
It's possible that your Apple Search Ads connector does not sync every table that this package expects. If your syncs exclude certain tables, it is because you either don't use that functionality in Apple Search Ads or actively excluded some tables from your syncs. To disable the corresponding functionality in the package, you must add the relevant variables. By default, the package assumes that all variables are true. Add variables for only the tables you want to disable. 

The `apple_search_ads__using_search_terms` variable below refers to the `search_terms_report` table. You must enable the [search match](https://searchads.apple.com/help/campaigns/0006-understand-search-match) function within each ad group to populate this table with data. 

```yml
# dbt_project.yml

...
config-version: 2

vars:
  apple_search_ads__using_search_terms: False # by default this is true
```

### Change the build schema
By default, this package builds the Apple Search Ads staging models within a schema titled (`<target_schema>` + `_apple_search_ads_source`) in your destination. If this is not where you would like your apple_search_ads staging data to be written to, add the following configuration to your root `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
models:
    apple_search_ads_source:
      +schema: my_new_schema_name # leave blank for just the target_schema
```
    
### Change the source table references
If an individual source table has a different name than the package expects, add the table name as it appears in your destination to the respective variable:
> IMPORTANT: See this project's [`dbt_project.yml`](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_apple_search_ads_source/blob/main/dbt_project.yml) variable declarations to see the expected names.
    
```yml
vars:
    apple_search_ads_<default_source_table_name>_identifier: your_table_name 
```
